Here, we screened 17 co-dominant nuclear microsatellite markers to investigate the hybridization and introgression of four oaks (Quercus acutissima, Quercus variabilis, Quercus fabri, and Quercus serrata) in 10 populations
We identified 361 alleles in the four-oak species across 17 loci, and all loci were characterized by high genetic variability (HE = 0.844–0.944) and moderate differentiation (FST = 0.037–0.156) levels. A population differentiation analysis revealed the following: allopatric homologous (FST = 0.064) < sympatric heterogeneous (FST = 0.071) < allopatric heterogeneous (FST = 0.084). A Bayesian admixture analysis determined four types of hybrids (Q. acutissima × Q. variabilis, Q. fabri × Q. serrata, Q. acutissima × Q. fabri, and Q. acutissima × Q. variabilis × Q. fabri) and their asymmetric introgression. Our results revealed that interspecific hybridization is commonly observed within the section Quercus, with members having tendency to hybridize.
